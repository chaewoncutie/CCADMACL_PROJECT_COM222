# CCADMACL_PROJECT_COM222
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project for COM222 class. The project aims to develop a model that clusters news based on its headlines and short descriptions.

## Project Overview

## Comparative Analysis of Clustering Techniques for Unsupervised News Categorization

This study leverages headlines and short descriptions from HuffPost articles (2012â€“2022) to train an unsupervised model for news clustering

The dataset was originally compiled from articles published by HuffPost and contains around 210,000 news headlines along with associated metadata. The articles were published between 2012 and 2022, providing a broad representation of news coverage over multiple years. Each record in the dataset corresponds to a distinct news article and is stored in JSON format. The dataset was compiled by Rishabh Misra, who obtained the data through web scraping from the HuffPost website.

Content Each record in the dataset consists of the following attributes:

1. category: category in which the article was published.

2. headline: the headline of the news article.

3. authors: list of authors who contributed to the article.

4. link: link to the original news article.

5. short_description: Abstract of the news article.

6. date: publication date of the article.
